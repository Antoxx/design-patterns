# Flyweight / Cache

Saves memory allocation by sharing common state among multiple instances.

Usage examples:

- Text Editors and Word Processors - managing character rendering, formatting and styles
- Game Development - sharing textures, models or terrain features across multiple game objects
- Data Visualization - rendering thousands of data points with shared visual properties
- UI Component Libraries - reusing styling and behaviour across many instances of the same component
- Map and Geo Apps - sharing common features like tree, building or road representations
