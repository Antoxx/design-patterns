# Bridge

Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two (implementation) can be vary/extended independently.

Examples:

1. Cross-platform applications

Abstraction: UI (button, window).
Implementation: different OSs (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. Device drivers

Abstraction: printer API.
Implementation: different drivers (HP, Canon, Epson).

3. Several APIs support

Abstraction: message sending.
Implementation: SMS, Email, Telegram.
